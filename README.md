# Walmart_Retail_Sales_Analysis_SQL
End-to-end SQL project analyzing retail performance and economic correlations using Walmart sales data.

1. Revenue Powerhouses
Insight: Out of 45 stores, Store 20 is the top performer, generating over $301 Million in total revenue.

Business Value: This helps management identify which locations have the most successful operational models that could be replicated in lower-performing stores.

2. The "Holiday Boost"
Insight: Average weekly sales during holidays (~$1.12M) are significantly higher than normal weeks (~$1.04M).
Business Value: This 7.8% increase proves the effectiveness of holiday promotions and suggests that inventory should be stocked at least 15% higher during these periods to avoid "out-of-stock" scenarios.

3. Economic Resilience
Insight: Even when unemployment hit its peak of 14.3% in late 2010, Walmart maintained strong sales (averaging nearly $1M in many affected weeks).

Business Value: This suggests Walmart acts as a "recession-proof" retailer. Consumers likely shifted their spending from luxury brands to Walmart’s value-priced goods during the crisis.

4. Growth Momentum (Store 1)
Insight: By analyzing the Running Total, we see that the last quarter of the year (Oct–Dec) contributes to a disproportionate amount of the annual growth.

Business Value: This highlights the critical importance of the "Q4" supply chain stability.
